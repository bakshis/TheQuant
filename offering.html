             <p class="dexcription8">The Bowen Technique (also known as Bowtech – the Original Bowen Technique and Bowenwork) is a dynamic system of muscle and connective soft tissue therapy, developed by late Tom Bowen in Geelong, Australia and documented and taught worldwide by the Founders Oswald and Elaine Rentsch with his permission since 1986. It provides relief for many types of injuries and health problems, both acute and chronic, and it does so holistically, via the body’s innate healing mechanisms. The practitioner’s procedures deliver signals through the fascia to the nervous system and the brain on a cellular level at speciﬁc locations (on muscles, tendons, ligaments, or nerves).The body responds within its vital capacity and does its own rectiﬁcation. Bowen Technique is appropriate for people of all ages, and addresses the entire body, by restoring balance via the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), which controls over 80% of bodily functions and is very susceptible to external stressors. During a session, the client often drops into deep relaxation and the common observation is that a Bowen Technique session seems to reactivate the recovery process in situations where healing from trauma, sickness or surgery has stalled or reached a plateau.  TQIW Members will be charged Rs.500/- per session, which is done only once a week. TQIW Members who are interested in training in this modality will be given a 10% <br>discount on the fees.<span class="description-underline"></span></p>

             <p class="description10">What tells us we are alive is a fundamental life force, a ﬂuid potency that underlies<br> our very existence. This life force maintains our optimum health and generates subtle rhythmic motion which is expressed by every cell. <span style="font-weight: bold;">All living organisms express this motion.</span> The cerebrospinal ﬂuid which bathes the central nervous system, exhibits this motion as a tide-like inhalation and exhalation, while bone, organs and other structures of the body follow their own particular patterns of movement within this. In a healthy body this fundamental life force is expressed ﬂuently but if health is compromised, on any level, this balanced rhythm will be disturbed and inevitably affect the overall vitality of your system. Through deep <b>presence</b> and <b>relational</b> touch the <b>craniosacral therapist</b> is trained to attune to these subtle rhythms and identify stress, trauma, illness and shock states. The therapist works with these patterns and ﬂuid motions supporting your body’s natural propensity to ﬁnd health and<br> equilibrium.<span class="description-underline"></span></p>
