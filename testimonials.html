                             “The event organised by TQIW was a unique forum where experts from the medical field, spiritual groups & patients interacted together. The engagement was truly enlightening & insightful. A lot more needs to be done to take this to a level where the scientist & skeptic in our minds gets  evidence to support the connection between mind , body & soul . Sister Shivani has the amazing ability to convey deep spiritual messages in very simple ways. Diseases of all kinds be it chronic degenerative, metabolic, auto immune , psychological or cancers are on the rise .Almost 2/3 of all cancers are diet related & lifestyle .A much more in - depth discussion on diet & food is needed to elaborate how diets have changed & impacted our health .  My belief is that most of our sufferings are preventable. My take away from the event was that care givers including doctors are in need of care themselves”.Ishi Khosla, TQIW Member, ikhosla2001@yahoo.com

"Just wanted to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude to TQIW Team for organizing and hosting this stimulating, and necessary event.Everyone from the audience to the panelists themselves, were grateful and pleasantly surprised to be a part of such a multi-dimensional dialogue that brought together so many diverse voices and perspectives to a rampant problem. The event was powerful in its ambitious attempt to move towards finding an integrated solution.I felt Dr. Gerd Mueller's comments on how it seemed as if each of the panelists was using a different language altogether given their varied perspectives, and the importance of finding a common language amidst the chaos of, often competing, ideologies was very apt.If we are ever to find this common language, it will arise from a collective recognition of a common goal, and an open forum to ponder and align towards a harmonious, holistic approach.This is exactly what TQIW is doing, and it's value cannot be understated! I am confident that in the months and years to come we will start seeing the results of these meaningful discourses, and I look forward to watching it unfold and being a part of it. “ Teyjas (Pranav Chaudhry), TQIW Guest, teyjas@devang.house</p>

Didi Shivani –no words for her even the whole atmosphere was very positive with her presence she stayed in whole event and make the environment positive and full of energy. All cancer fighters were chosen wonderfully different motivational stories attached  with them –must have motivated the audience .  Cancer –the term which creates terror in the mind but can- certainly be prevented /treated timely. Prevention is better than cure so if we can prevent the cancer nothing like it. As such treatment is concern success rates are high when diagnosed early. We not only need to treat the cancer but also to heal the mind and body. Combined approach will be more helpful in treating cancer patients we can combined modern system of medicine with other alternative system of medicine. As health by who is defined as physical, social , mental and spiritual well being. Health awareness is key and combined all system of medicine –a challenge in which quantum health can play a big role –a need of society”.Dr.Ruby Bansal, TQIW Guest, rsb_bansal@rediffmail.com</p>

The speakers brought in tremendous insight on a subject which is not fully known and every one of them acknowledged that their own knowledge is limited with a lot of humility. The real life stories shared by people who got cured by holistic and positive approach was really inspiring. Sister Shivani's speech was as usual very thought provoking. But listening to her directly than thru the TV shows was nice. "S Sandilya, TQIW Member, ssandilya@eichermotors.com<span></span>

"Interacting with other cancer survivors and learning how different individuals had combatted the same disease enabled me to evaluate my own responses. At the same time, it was extremely  gratifying to learn that there was a basic commonality in our individual approach. The treatment for cancer is both mentally and physically demanding. While I am not a medical person, thus not in a position to comment on the causes of cancer and/or the line of treatment to be adopted, having beaten it, my advise will be to face the situation with self confidence, the right attitude and mental fortitude. Locate and thereafter fix your faith with the doctors and just go with the flow. I allowed my support group, comprising of my family and friends, to support my emotional needs and keep me motivated. I applaud TQIW and its team for organising an informative event and providing the platform to discuss the need for holistic wellbeing of cancer patients. Doctors and alternative healers must realise that the time has come for them to come together for the benefit of patients and survivors alike. Cheers to TQIW for taking the lead in that regard.”Varun Shankar, Panelist, varun_shank@yahoo.com</p>
